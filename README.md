# Ecommerce Sales Analysis

---

## Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of an Ecommerce dataset, focusing on sales performance, customer behavior, operational efficiency, and time trends. The analysis is divided into three phases:

1. **SQL Analysis**
2. **Interactive Dashboard Creation (Power BI)**
3. **Python and Machine Learning**

---

## Phase 1: SQL Analysis – Advanced Queries

### Objective

To perform advanced data analysis using MySQL queries to answer key business questions and extract meaningful insights related to sales, customers, operations, and time trends.

### Tasks and Questions

1. **Sales Performance Analysis**

   - Calculate total sales revenue per category, sub-category, and region.
   - Identify the top 5 best-selling products by both sales revenue and quantity sold.

2. **Customer Insights**

   - Find the most loyal customers based on purchase frequency and total spend.
   - Identify customers with the highest average order value (AOV).

3. **Operational Efficiency**

   - Analyze average delivery time by region.
   - Identify regions or products with the highest delivery success rates.

4. **Date and Time Analytics**

   - Determine the monthly sales trend for the last two years.
   - Analyze seasonality of sales to identify peak months.

5. **Advanced SQL Queries**

   - Use window functions to rank products based on sales within each category.
   - Calculate month-to-date (MTD) and year-to-date (YTD) sales metrics.

## Phase 2: Data Visualization – Power BI

### Objective

To create an interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics derived from SQL analysis, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

### Key Metrics Visualized

1. **Sales Performance**

   - Total Sales Revenue: Overall revenue generated.
   - Average Order Value (AOV): Average revenue per order.
   - Sales by Category and Sub-Category: Revenue breakdown.
   - Top-Selling Products: Top 5 products by sales revenue.

2. **Customer Insights**

   - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Total revenue per customer.
   - Top 10 Loyal Customers: Customers with the highest purchase frequency and spend.
   - Customer Segments: Categorized by purchasing behavior (e.g., high spenders, one-time buyers).

3. **Regional Analysis**

   - Revenue by Region: Regional sales comparisons.
   - Return Rates by Region: Percentage of canceled orders.
   - Average Delivery Time by Region: Operational performance.

4. **Operational Metrics**

   - Delivery Time Analysis: Average, minimum, and maximum delivery times.
   - Product Return Rates: Percentage of returned products across categories.

5. **Time Trends**

   - Monthly Sales Trends: Visualization of revenue trends over time.
   - Seasonality Analysis: Highlighting peak sales periods (e.g., festive months).

## Phase 3: Python and Machine Learning

### Objective

To apply machine learning techniques for advanced analytics and predictions based on the Ecommerce dataset.

### Key Tasks

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

   - Handle missing values and ensure data consistency.
   - Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   - Identify patterns, correlations, and trends in the data.

3. **Machine Learning Models**

   - Build models to predict sales and customer behavior.
   - Implement clustering techniques to segment customers.

4. **Model Evaluation**

   - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
